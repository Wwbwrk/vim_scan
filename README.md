# Vim Scan

This project is to provide source code scans for older versions of Vim so that entities that required open source software source code scans can approve it for installation. (Ref: [DoD Software Development and Open Source Software](https://dodcio.defense.gov/portals/0/documents/library/softwaredev-opensource.pdf)).  

This repository contains a clone of the [Vim Repository](https://github.com/vim/vim) that includes a specific release.  See the `/scan` directory for results.
